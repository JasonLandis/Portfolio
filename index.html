                                Constellation is a shoot-em-up roguelike arcade game for mobile. This was my first published game
                                and it is currently only available on android. I plan to make it available for iphones and PCs in the future.
                                It was developed using the Unity engine and took me approximately 3 months to complete. 
                            </p>
                            <h2>How to play</h2>
                            <p>
                                You play as a star within a universe surrounded by other stars. Select a direction and a distance
                                to begin travelling throughout the universe and grow your constellation. While travelling, you must avoid asteroids.
                                As you traverse further from the center, the game will get more difficult, but when you land on another star, you can 
                                select an upgrade, making the game easier.

                                Pathfinder was one of my first projects. It is currently a prototype but I plan to work
                                on it more in the future.

                                You are given a map with a number of tiles including a start tile and an end tile. On the start tile, there is a character that
                                searches for the most optimal path to the end tile. Once you hit the play button on the top left of the screen, the character begins
                                to move towards the end tile. The goal of the game is to prevent the character from reaching the end tile within
                                a certain amount of time. You can stall the character by placing blockades causing it to reroute its path.
